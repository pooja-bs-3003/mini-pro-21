# **PROJECT TITLE :**

#### DEPLOY MACHINE LEARNING MODEL ON WEBSITE USING FLASK

Website consists of following pages :

- ###### LOGIN 

- ###### PROJECT CREATION 

- ###### DATA & PRE-PROCESSING

- ###### MODEL HUB

- ###### MODEL PERFORMANCE

- ###### REVISITING

#### LOGIN :

- Login page as "SIGN IN" & "SIGN UP" pages.
- New user has to create his account . So he has to select SIGN-UP page & give essential details.
- User who have already account selects SIGN-IN page.

#### PROJECT CREATION :

- User creates new project.  To create project  necessary  data user has to provide are

- ###### NAME OF PROJECT

- TRAINING DATA : The **data** used to train an algorithm or machine learning model to predict outcome

- TEST DATA : The **data** is used to measure the performance, such as accuracy or efficiency, of the algorithm

###### **DATA DISPLAY & PRE-PROCESSING :**

- Here , user give the details about number of columns & rows to be dropped which are not required to train the model.

- User has to provide for which are the columns pre-processing are to be done.

  ### PRE-PROCESSING  OF DATA 

  

![Data Preprocessing, Analysis & Visualization - Python Machine Learning -  DataFlair](https://data-flair.training/blogs/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2018/07/Data-Preprocessing-in-Python-Machine-Learning-01.jpg)



###### MODEL HUB :

- After pre-processing , here user has to select type type of model that user wants to train.

- There are two categories of models that a user can create & train. They are **''CLASSIFICATION"** & **"REGRESSION"**

##### TYPES OF CLASSIFICATION ALGORITHMS :



![Classification Algorithms | 5 Amazing Types Of Classification Algorithms](https://cdn.educba.com/academy/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/Explain-Classification-Algorithms-in-Detail.png)

- In our website models can be trained for all  above algorithms except Support Vector Machine algorithm.

#### TYPES OF REGRESSION ALGORITHMS :

- LINEAR REGRESSION
- RANDOM FOREST
- K- NEAREST NEIGHBORS



- After selecting type of algorithm , user has to provide required parameters to train the model.
- Once the model is created, name of the model & weights are sent to next page to  determine the performance of the model.

###### MODEL PERFORMANCE :

- Here performance of model is determined . The performance of model is checked for all algorithms because user wants to  know which algorithm gives better accuracy.

Classification  Evaluation Metrics :

REGRESSION EVALUATION METRICS :

- Root Mean Square Error  & R2 score are used to evaluate or check the performance of Regression model. RMSE is calculated as shown below

![Root-Mean-Square Error in R Programming - GeeksforGeeks](https://media.geeksforgeeks.org/wp-content/uploads/20200622171741/RMSE1.jpg)

- R2 SCORE is calculated as :

###### REVISITING :

- User  already  had created many projects and if he/she wants to revisit particular project and check the performance of that model, this page helps user to revisit by providing essential data of that model.

###### MODEL INFERENCE :

- Here user has to provide name of project &  he /she can give new data for prediction  according to the same format of training data .

- The model predicts value for new data & value will be displayed.
